/**
 * <p>
 * QR decompositions decompose a rectangular matrix 'A' such that 'A=QR'.  Where
 * A &isin; &real; <sup>n &times; m</sup> , n &ge; m, Q &isin; &real; <sup>n &times; n</sup> is an orthogonal matrix,
 * and R &isin; &real; <sup>n &times; m</sup> is an upper triangular matrix.  Some implementations
 * of QR decomposition require that A has full rank.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Some features of QR decompositions:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Can decompose rectangular matrices. </li>
 * <li> Numerically stable solutions to least-squares problem, but not as stable as SVD </li>
 * <li> Can incrementally add and remove columns from the decomposed matrix.  See {@link org.ejml.alg.dense.linsol.qr.AdjLinearSolverQr} </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Orthogonal matrices have the following properties:
 * <ul>
 * <li>QQ<sup>T</sup>=I</li>
 * <li>Q<sup>T</sup>=Q<sup>-1</sup></li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
