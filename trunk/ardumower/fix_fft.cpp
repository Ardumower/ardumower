/* fix_fft.c - Fixed-point in-place Fast Fourier Transform  */
/*
  All data are fixed-point short integers, in which -128
  to +128 represent -1.0 to +1.0 respectively. Integer
  arithmetic is used for speed, instead of the more natural
  floating-point.

  For the forward FFT (time -> freq), fixed scaling is
  performed to prevent arithmetic overflow, and to map a 0dB
  sine/cosine wave (i.e. amplitude = 127) to two -6dB freq
  coefficients. The return value is always 0.

  For the inverse FFT (freq -> time), fixed scaling cannot be
  done, as two 0dB coefficients would sum to a peak amplitude
  of 64K, overflowing the 32k range of the fixed-point integers.
  Thus, the fix_fft() routine performs variable scaling, and
  returns a value which is the number of bits LEFT by which
  the output must be shifted to get the actual amplitude
  (i.e. if fix_fft() returns 3, each value of fr[] and fi[]
  must be multiplied by 8 (2**3) for proper scaling.
  Clearly, this cannot be done within fixed-point short
  integers. In practice, if the result is to be used as a
  filter, the scale_shift can usually be ignored, as the
  result will be approximately correctly normalized as is.
