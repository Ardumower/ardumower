--Wiring--


Ok, here's a summary of the changes for the Due wiring:

1. Due
The Due runs at 3.3V - all signal lines connected to the Due have to run at 3.3V too. If it's not possible to run a specific sensor module at 3.3V, keep 5V for that module and use a voltage divider for the signal line of that module:

[code]
5V sensor signal out --10k---+---20k---GND
                             | 
                 Arduino Due signal in
[/code]

2. Mega Sensor shield
If using the Mega sensor shield (recommended), make sure to remove jumper "PWR_SEL" on the Mega shield, so all "V" pins are open (and no longer connected to 5V). Then connect any 3.3V pin (e.g. "Bluetooth" pin no.1) to one "V" pin, so all "V" pins get 3.3V instead of 5V.

3. Motor drivers
Motor drivers, MOSFET mower driver and current sensors will be replaced by 2 x dual MC33926. The MC driver has built-in current sensor and it's 3.3V compatible. Same signal lines for the Due as on the Mega.   

4. Perimeter Nano
The perimeter Arduino Nano is obsolete now. Also, we are using only one coil now. The LM386 is not designed for 3.3V (although you might get it to work). Use a voltage divider for the output signal (see point 1). 

[code]
LM386 in  --- 100 mH coil ----- 4.7nF --+
LM386 GND ------------------------------+ 
LM386 out --- 10k --- Arduino Due pin A5 -- 20k -- GND
LM386 VCC --- 5V
[/code] 
     
5. Perimeter sender
The perimeter sender is using a dual MC33926 motor driver and new sender code (new signal).

[code]
motor driver M1OUT1 o---------- perimeter loop (20-450 meter)--+
                                                               |
motor driver M1OUT2 o------------------------------------------+
motor driver Vin    o-- 12V
motor driver M1IN1  o-- Arduino Nano IN1
motor driver M1IN2  o-- Arduino Nano IN2
motor driver VDD    o-- Arduino +5V
motor driver EN     o-- VDD (via Jumper)
motor driver M1D1   o-- GND (via Jumper)
motor driver M1D2   o-- VDD (via Jumper) 
[/code]

6. IMU
The IMU Arduino Nano is obsolete now. Run it at 3.3V instead 5V. 

[code]
IMU VCC3.3 --- 3.3V
IMU SCL    --- Arduino Due SCL         
IMU SDA    --- Arduino Due SDA
[/code]

7. Bluetooth module
Bluetooth module will run at 3.3V, no voltage divider for RX line anymore.

8. Charge sensing
Current sensor ACS712-05 is not designed for 3.3V, so use a voltage divider if your signal voltage is too high (>3.3V) for your charging current.  

9. Ultrasonic
HC-SR04 is not designed for 3.3V, so use a voltage divider for Echo line.
