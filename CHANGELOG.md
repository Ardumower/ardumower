2015-06-03 added missing values in Robot::printSettingSerial()
2015-06-03 mower now uses perimeter as default new defaults: motorZeroSettleTime, motorRollTimeMax, motorRollTimeMin, motorReverseTime, motorForwTimeMax, sonarTriggerBelow, perimeterTrackRollTime, perimeterTrackRevTime
2015-06-03 improved driving behavior
2015-05-31 new default: motorSwapDir = 0; for both driving motors current measurements from MC are more reliable
2015-05-31 new default: using only one channel of our motor odometry encoder solves https://github.com/Ardumower/ardumower/issues/35
2015-05-31 corrected version number
2015-05-31 improved handling of sonar sensors sonar sensor readings and caused behavior should now be more reliable

2015-05-31 improved checkPerimeterBoundary behavior mower now moves back in when driven outside perimeter while driving backwards
2015-05-29 bugfix for Robot::checkIfStucked() added STATE_ERROR
2015-05-29 initial stuck detection feature if GPS is in use the mower can now detect if itÂ´s stucked if stucked the mower tries to set free, if not successful mower is switched into ERROR
2015-05-25 now time and date under DATE/TIME are always shown fixes https://github.com/Ardumower/ardumower/issues/42
2015-05-25 added motorRollTimeMin implements https://github.com/Ardumower/ardumower/issues/41 so we are in better control of robot movement

2015-05-25 fixes https://github.com/Ardumower/ardumower/issues/36
2015-05-25 Due to safety issues timer is only active when mower is in STATE_STATION. when mower is OFF it stays OFF. It represents now the actuall state machine http://wiki.ardumower.de/index.php?title=Ardumower_software_design
