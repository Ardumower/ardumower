<h3 class="section">3.2 Options Controlling the Kind of Output</h3>

<p>Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  GCC is capable of
preprocessing and compiling several files either into several
assembler input files, or into one assembler input file; then each
assembler input file produces an object file, and linking combines all
the object files (those newly compiled, and those specified as input)
into an executable file.

 <p><a name="index-file-name-suffix-73"></a>For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
compilation is done:

     <dl>
<dt><var>file</var><code>.c</code><dd>C source code which must be preprocessed.

     <br><dt><var>file</var><code>.i</code><dd>C source code which should not be preprocessed.

Note that in <span class="samp">.cxx</span>,
the last two letters must both be literally <span class="samp">x</span>.  Likewise,

<br><dt><var>file</var><code>.ads</code><dd>Ada source code file which contains a library unit declaration (a
declaration of a package, subprogram, or generic, or a generic
instantiation), or a library unit renaming declaration (a package,
generic, or subprogram renaming declaration).  Such files are also
called <dfn>specs</dfn>.

     <dt><var>file</var><code>.adb</code><dd>Ada source code file containing a library unit body (a subprogram or

     <br><dt><var>other</var><dd>An object file to be fed straight into linking. 
Any file name with no recognized suffix is treated this way. 
</dl>

 <p><a name="index-x-74"></a>You can specify the input language explicitly with the <span class="option">-x</span> option:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-x </code><var>language</var><dd>Specify explicitly the <var>language</var> for the following input files
(rather than letting the compiler choose a default based on the file
name suffix).  This option applies to all following input files until
the next <span class="option">-x</span> option.  Possible values for <var>language</var> are:
     <pre class="smallexample">          c  c-header  c-cpp-output
          c++  c++-header  c++-cpp-output
          objective-c  objective-c-header  objective-c-cpp-output
          objective-c++ objective-c++-header objective-c++-cpp-output
          assembler  assembler-with-cpp
          ada
          f95  f95-cpp-input
          java
          treelang
     </pre>
     <br><dt><code>-x none</code><dd>Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent files are
handled according to their file name suffixes (as they are if <span class="option">-x</span>
has not been used at all).

     <br><dt><code>-pass-exit-codes</code><dd><a name="index-pass_002dexit_002dcodes-75"></a>Normally the <span class="command">gcc</span> program will exit with the code of 1 if any
phase of the compiler returns a non-success return code.  If you specify
<span class="option">-pass-exit-codes</span>, the <span class="command">gcc</span> program will instead return with
numerically highest error produced by any phase that returned an error
indication.  The C, C++, and Fortran frontends return 4, if an internal
compiler error is encountered. 
</dl>

 <p>If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use
<span class="option">-x</span> (or filename suffixes) to tell <span class="command">gcc</span> where to start, and
one of the options <span class="option">-c</span>, <span class="option">-S</span>, or <span class="option">-E</span> to say where
<span class="command">gcc</span> is to stop.  Note that some combinations (for example,
<span class="samp">-x cpp-output -E</span>) instruct <span class="command">gcc</span> to do nothing at all.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-c</code><dd><a name="index-c-76"></a>Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
object file for each source file.

     <p>By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing
the suffix <span class="samp">.c</span>, <span class="samp">.i</span>, <span class="samp">.s</span>, etc., with <span class="samp">.o</span>.

     <p>Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are
ignored.

     <br><dt><code>-S</code><dd><a name="index-S-77"></a>Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The output
is in the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input
file specified.

     <p>By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by
replacing the suffix <span class="samp">.c</span>, <span class="samp">.i</span>, etc., with <span class="samp">.s</span>.

     <p>Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.

     <br><dt><code>-E</code><dd><a name="index-E-78"></a>Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper.  The
output is in the form of preprocessed source code, which is sent to the
standard output.

     <p>Input files which don't require preprocessing are ignored.

     <p><a name="index-output-file-option-79"></a><br><dt><code>-o </code><var>file</var><dd><a name="index-o-80"></a>Place output in file <var>file</var>.  This applies regardless to whatever
sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.

     <p>If <span class="option">-o</span> is not specified, the default is to put an executable
file in <span class="file">a.out</span>, the object file for
<var>source</var><span class="file">.</span><var>suffix</var> in <var>source</var><span class="file">.o</span>, its
assembler file in <var>source</var><span class="file">.s</span>, a precompiled header file in
<var>source</var><span class="file">.</span><var>suffix</var><span class="file">.gch</span>, and all preprocessed C source on
standard output.

     <br><dt><code>-v</code><dd><a name="index-v-81"></a>Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the stages
of compilation.  Also print the version number of the compiler driver
program and of the preprocessor and the compiler proper.

     <br><dt><code>-###</code><dd><a name="index-_0023_0023_0023-82"></a>Like <span class="option">-v</span> except the commands are not executed and all command
arguments are quoted.  This is useful for shell scripts to capture the
driver-generated command lines.

     <br><dt><code>-pipe</code><dd><a name="index-pipe-83"></a>Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication between the
various stages of compilation.  This fails to work on some systems where
the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; but the GNU assembler has
no trouble.

     <br><dt><code>-combine</code><dd><a name="index-combine-84"></a>If you are compiling multiple source files, this option tells the driver
to pass all the source files to the compiler at once (for those
languages for which the compiler can handle this).  This will allow
intermodule analysis (IMA) to be performed by the compiler.  Currently the only
language for which this is supported is C.  If you pass source files for
multiple languages to the driver, using this option, the driver will invoke
the compiler(s) that support IMA once each, passing each compiler all the
source files appropriate for it.  For those languages that do not support
IMA this option will be ignored, and the compiler will be invoked once for
each source file in that language.  If you use this option in conjunction
with <span class="option">-save-temps</span>, the compiler will generate multiple
pre-processed files
(one for each source file), but only one (combined) <span class="file">.o</span> or
<span class="file">.s</span> file.

     <br><dt><code>--help</code><dd><a name="index-help-85"></a>Print (on the standard output) a description of the command line options
understood by <span class="command">gcc</span>.  If the <span class="option">-v</span> option is also specified
then <span class="option">--help</span> will also be passed on to the various processes
invoked by <span class="command">gcc</span>, so that they can display the command line options
they accept.  If the <span class="option">-Wextra</span> option has also been specified
(prior to the <span class="option">--help</span> option), then command line options which
have no documentation associated with them will also be displayed.

     <br><dt><code>--target-help</code><dd><a name="index-target_002dhelp-86"></a>Print (on the standard output) a description of target-specific command
line options for each tool.  For some targets extra target-specific
information may also be printed.

     <br><dt><code>--help=</code><var>class</var><span class="roman">[</span><code>,</code><var>qualifier</var><span class="roman">]</span><dd>Print (on the standard output) a description of the command line
options understood by the compiler that fit into a specific class. 
The class can be one of <span class="samp">optimizers</span>, <span class="samp">warnings</span>, <span class="samp">target</span>,
<span class="samp">params</span>, or <var>language</var>:

          <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">optimizers</span><dd>This will display all of the optimization options supported by the
compiler.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">warnings</span><dd>This will display all of the options controlling warning messages
produced by the compiler.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">target</span><dd>This will display target-specific options.  Unlike the
<span class="option">--target-help</span> option however, target-specific options of the
linker and assembler will not be displayed.  This is because those
tools do not currently support the extended <span class="option">--help=</span> syntax.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">params</span><dd>This will display the values recognized by the <span class="option">--param</span>
option.

          <br><dt><var>language</var><dd>This will display the options supported for <var>language</var>, where
<var>language</var> is the name of one of the languages supported in this
version of GCC.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">common</span><dd>This will display the options that are common to all languages. 
</dl>

     <p>It is possible to further refine the output of the <span class="option">--help=</span>
option by adding a comma separated list of qualifiers after the
class.  These can be any from the following list:

          <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">undocumented</span><dd>Display only those options which are undocumented.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">joined</span><dd>Display options which take an argument that appears after an equal
sign in the same continuous piece of text, such as:
<span class="samp">--help=target</span>.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">separate</span><dd>Display options which take an argument that appears as a separate word
following the original option, such as: <span class="samp">-o output-file</span>. 
</dl>

     <p>Thus for example to display all the undocumented target-specific
switches supported by the compiler the following can be used:

     <pre class="smallexample">          --help=target,undocumented
     </pre>
     <p>The sense of a qualifier can be inverted by prefixing it with the
<var>^</var> character, so for example to display all binary warning
options (i.e., ones that are either on or off and that do not take an
argument), which have a description the following can be used:

     <pre class="smallexample">          --help=warnings,^joined,^undocumented
     </pre>
     <p>A class can also be used as a qualifier, although this usually
restricts the output by so much that there is nothing to display.  One
case where it does work however is when one of the classes is
<var>target</var>.  So for example to display all the target-specific
optimization options the following can be used:

     <pre class="smallexample">          --help=target,optimizers
     </pre>
     <p>The <span class="option">--help=</span> option can be repeated on the command line.  Each
successive use will display its requested class of options, skipping
those that have already been displayed.

     <p>If the <span class="option">-Q</span> option appears on the command line before the
<span class="option">--help=</span> option, then the descriptive text displayed by
<span class="option">--help=</span> is changed.  Instead of describing the displayed
options, an indication is given as to whether the option is enabled,
disabled or set to a specific value (assuming that the compiler
knows this at the point where the <span class="option">--help=</span> option is used).

     <p>Here is a truncated example from the ARM port of <span class="command">gcc</span>:

     <pre class="smallexample">            % gcc -Q -mabi=2 --help=target -c
            The following options are target specific:
            -mabi=                                2
            -mabort-on-noreturn                   [disabled]
            -mapcs                                [disabled]
     </pre>
     <p>The output is sensitive to the effects of previous command line
options, so for example it is possible to find out which optimizations
are enabled at <span class="option">-O2</span> by using:

     <pre class="smallexample">          -O2 --help=optimizers
     </pre>
     <p>Alternatively you can discover which binary optimizations are enabled
by <span class="option">-O3</span> by using:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -c -Q -O3 --help=optimizers &gt; /tmp/O3-opts
          gcc -c -Q -O2 --help=optimizers &gt; /tmp/O2-opts
          diff /tmp/O2-opts /tmp/O3-opts | grep enabled
     </pre>
     <br><dt><code>--version</code><dd><a name="index-version-87"></a>Display the version number and copyrights of the invoked GCC.
