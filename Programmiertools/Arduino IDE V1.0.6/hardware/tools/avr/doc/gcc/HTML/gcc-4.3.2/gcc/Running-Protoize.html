<h3 class="section">3.21 Running Protoize</h3>

<p>The program <code>protoize</code> is an optional part of GCC.  You can use
it to add prototypes to a program, thus converting the program to ISO
C in one respect.  The companion program <code>unprotoize</code> does the
reverse: it removes argument types from any prototypes that are found.

 <p>When you run these programs, you must specify a set of source files as
command line arguments.  The conversion programs start out by compiling
these files to see what functions they define.  The information gathered
about a file <var>foo</var> is saved in a file named <var>foo</var><span class="file">.X</span>.

 <p>After scanning comes actual conversion.  The specified files are all
eligible to be converted; any files they include (whether sources or
just headers) are eligible as well.

 <p>But not all the eligible files are converted.  By default,
<code>protoize</code> and <code>unprotoize</code> convert only source and header
files in the current directory.  You can specify additional directories
whose files should be converted with the <span class="option">-d </span><var>directory</var>
option.  You can also specify particular files to exclude with the
<span class="option">-x </span><var>file</var> option.  A file is converted if it is eligible, its
directory name matches one of the specified directory names, and its
name within the directory has not been excluded.

 <p>Basic conversion with <code>protoize</code> consists of rewriting most
function definitions and function declarations to specify the types of
the arguments.  The only ones not rewritten are those for varargs
functions.

 <p><code>protoize</code> optionally inserts prototype declarations at the
beginning of the source file, to make them available for any calls that
precede the function's definition.  Or it can insert prototype
declarations with block scope in the blocks where undeclared functions
are called.

 <p>Basic conversion with <code>unprotoize</code> consists of rewriting most
function declarations to remove any argument types, and rewriting
function definitions to the old-style pre-ISO form.

 <p>Both conversion programs print a warning for any function declaration or
definition that they can't convert.  You can suppress these warnings
with <span class="option">-q</span>.

 <p>The output from <code>protoize</code> or <code>unprotoize</code> replaces the
original source file.  The original file is renamed to a name ending
with <span class="samp">.save</span> (for DOS, the saved filename ends in <span class="samp">.sav</span>
without the original <span class="samp">.c</span> suffix).  If the <span class="samp">.save</span> (<span class="samp">.sav</span>
for DOS) file already exists, then the source file is simply discarded.

 <p><code>protoize</code> and <code>unprotoize</code> both depend on GCC itself to
scan the program and collect information about the functions it uses. 
So neither of these programs will work until GCC is installed.

 <p>Here is a table of the options you can use with <code>protoize</code> and
<code>unprotoize</code>.  Each option works with both programs unless
otherwise stated.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-B </code><var>directory</var><dd>Look for the file <span class="file">SYSCALLS.c.X</span> in <var>directory</var>, instead of the
usual directory (normally <span class="file">/usr/local/lib</span>).  This file contains
prototype information about standard system functions.  This option
applies only to <code>protoize</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-c </code><var>compilation-options</var><dd>Use <var>compilation-options</var> as the options when running <span class="command">gcc</span> to
produce the <span class="samp">.X</span> files.  The special option <span class="option">-aux-info</span> is
always passed in addition, to tell <span class="command">gcc</span> to write a <span class="samp">.X</span> file.

     <p>Note that the compilation options must be given as a single argument to
<code>protoize</code> or <code>unprotoize</code>.  If you want to specify several
<span class="command">gcc</span> options, you must quote the entire set of compilation options
to make them a single word in the shell.

     <p>There are certain <span class="command">gcc</span> arguments that you cannot use, because they
would produce the wrong kind of output.  These include <span class="option">-g</span>,
<span class="option">-O</span>, <span class="option">-c</span>, <span class="option">-S</span>, and <span class="option">-o</span> If you include these in
the <var>compilation-options</var>, they are ignored.

     <br><dt><code>-C</code><dd>Rename files to end in <span class="samp">.C</span> (<span class="samp">.cc</span> for DOS-based file
systems) instead of <span class="samp">.c</span>.  This is convenient if you are converting
a C program to C++.  This option applies only to <code>protoize</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-g</code><dd>Add explicit global declarations.  This means inserting explicit
declarations at the beginning of each source file for each function
that is called in the file and was not declared.  These declarations
precede the first function definition that contains a call to an
undeclared function.  This option applies only to <code>protoize</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-i </code><var>string</var><dd>Indent old-style parameter declarations with the string <var>string</var>. 
This option applies only to <code>protoize</code>.

     <p><code>unprotoize</code> converts prototyped function definitions to old-style
function definitions, where the arguments are declared between the
argument list and the initial <span class="samp">{</span>.  By default, <code>unprotoize</code>
uses five spaces as the indentation.  If you want to indent with just
one space instead, use <span class="option">-i " "</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-k</code><dd>Keep the <span class="samp">.X</span> files.  Normally, they are deleted after conversion
is finished.

     <br><dt><code>-l</code><dd>Add explicit local declarations.  <code>protoize</code> with <span class="option">-l</span> inserts
a prototype declaration for each function in each block which calls the
function without any declaration.  This option applies only to
<code>protoize</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-n</code><dd>Make no real changes.  This mode just prints information about the conversions
that would have been done without <span class="option">-n</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-N</code><dd>Make no <span class="samp">.save</span> files.  The original files are simply deleted. 
Use this option with caution.

     <br><dt><code>-p </code><var>program</var><dd>Use the program <var>program</var> as the compiler.  Normally, the name
<span class="file">gcc</span> is used.

     <br><dt><code>-q</code><dd>Work quietly.  Most warnings are suppressed.

     <br><dt><code>-v</code><dd>Print the version number, just like <span class="option">-v</span> for <span class="command">gcc</span>. 
</dl>

 <p>If you need special compiler options to compile one of your program's
source files, then you should generate that file's <span class="samp">.X</span> file
specially, by running <span class="command">gcc</span> on that source file with the
appropriate options and the option <span class="option">-aux-info</span>.  Then run
<code>protoize</code> on the entire set of files.  <code>protoize</code> will use
the existing <span class="samp">.X</span> file because it is newer than the source file. 
For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     gcc -Dfoo=bar file1.c -aux-info file1.X
     protoize *.c
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">You need to include the special files along with the rest in the
<code>protoize</code> command, even though their <span class="samp">.X</span> files already
exist, because otherwise they won't get converted.

 <p>See <a href="Protoize-Caveats.html#Protoize-Caveats">Protoize Caveats</a>, for more information on how to use
<code>protoize</code> successfully.
