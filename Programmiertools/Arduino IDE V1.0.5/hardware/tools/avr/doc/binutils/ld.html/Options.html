<h3 class="section">2.1 Command Line Options</h3>

   <p><a name="index-command-line-3"></a><a name="index-options-4"></a>
<!-- man begin OPTIONS -->

   <p>The linker supports a plethora of command-line options, but in actual
practice few of them are used in any particular context. 
<a name="index-standard-Unix-system-5"></a>For instance, a frequent use of <span class="command">ld</span> is to link standard Unix
object files on a standard, supported Unix system.  On such a system, to
link a file <code>hello.o</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     ld -o <var>output</var> /lib/crt0.o hello.o -lc
</pre>
   <p>This tells <span class="command">ld</span> to produce a file called <var>output</var> as the
result of linking the file <code>/lib/crt0.o</code> with <code>hello.o</code> and
the library <code>libc.a</code>, which will come from the standard search
directories.  (See the discussion of the <span class="samp">-l</span> option below.)

   <p>Some of the command-line options to <span class="command">ld</span> may be specified at any
point in the command line.  However, options which refer to files, such
as <span class="samp">-l</span> or <span class="samp">-T</span>, cause the file to be read at the point at
which the option appears in the command line, relative to the object
files and other file options.  Repeating non-file options with a
different argument will either have no further effect, or override prior
occurrences (those further to the left on the command line) of that
option.  Options which may be meaningfully specified more than once are
noted in the descriptions below.

   <p><a name="index-object-files-6"></a>Non-option arguments are object files or archives which are to be linked
together.  They may follow, precede, or be mixed in with command-line
options, except that an object file argument may not be placed between
an option and its argument.

   <p>Usually the linker is invoked with at least one object file, but you can
specify other forms of binary input files using <span class="samp">-l</span>, <span class="samp">-R</span>,
and the script command language.  If <em>no</em> binary input files at all
are specified, the linker does not produce any output, and issues the
message <span class="samp">No input files</span>.

   <p>If the linker cannot recognize the format of an object file, it will
assume that it is a linker script.  A script specified in this way
augments the main linker script used for the link (either the default
linker script or the one specified by using <span class="samp">-T</span>).  This feature
permits the linker to link against a file which appears to be an object
or an archive, but actually merely defines some symbol values, or uses
<code>INPUT</code> or <code>GROUP</code> to load other objects.  Specifying a
script in this way merely augments the main linker script, with the
extra commands placed after the main script; use the <span class="samp">-T</span> option
to replace the default linker script entirely, but note the effect of
the <code>INSERT</code> command.  See <a href="Scripts.html#Scripts">Scripts</a>.

   <p>For options whose names are a single letter,
option arguments must either follow the option letter without intervening
whitespace, or be given as separate arguments immediately following the
option that requires them.

   <p>For options whose names are multiple letters, either one dash or two can
precede the option name; for example, <span class="samp">-trace-symbol</span> and
<span class="samp">--trace-symbol</span> are equivalent.  Note&mdash;there is one exception to
this rule.  Multiple letter options that start with a lower case 'o' can
only be preceded by two dashes.  This is to reduce confusion with the
<span class="samp">-o</span> option.  So for example <span class="samp">-omagic</span> sets the output file
name to <span class="samp">magic</span> whereas <span class="samp">--omagic</span> sets the NMAGIC flag on the
output.

   <p>Arguments to multiple-letter options must either be separated from the
option name by an equals sign, or be given as separate arguments
immediately following the option that requires them.  For example,
<span class="samp">--trace-symbol foo</span> and <span class="samp">--trace-symbol=foo</span> are equivalent. 
Unique abbreviations of the names of multiple-letter options are
accepted.

   <p>Note&mdash;if the linker is being invoked indirectly, via a compiler driver
(e.g. <span class="samp">gcc</span>) then all the linker command line options should be
prefixed by <span class="samp">-Wl,</span> (or whatever is appropriate for the particular
compiler driver) like this:

<pre class="smallexample">       gcc -Wl,--startgroup foo.o bar.o -Wl,--endgroup
</pre>
   <p>This is important, because otherwise the compiler driver program may
silently drop the linker options, resulting in a bad link.

   <p>Here is a table of the generic command line switches accepted by the GNU
linker:

     <dl>
<!-- This file is designed to be included in manuals that use -->
<!-- expandargv. -->

     <dt><code>@</code><var>file</var><dd>Read command-line options from <var>file</var>.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @<var>file</var> option.  If <var>file</var>
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.

     <p>Options in <var>file</var> are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The <var>file</var> may itself contain additional
@<var>file</var> options; any such options will be processed recursively.

     <p><a name="index-_002da_0040var_007bkeyword_007d-7"></a><br><dt><code>-a</code><var>keyword</var><dd>This option is supported for HP/UX compatibility.  The <var>keyword</var>
argument must be one of the strings <span class="samp">archive</span>, <span class="samp">shared</span>, or
<span class="samp">default</span>.  <span class="samp">-aarchive</span> is functionally equivalent to
<span class="samp">-Bstatic</span>, and the other two keywords are functionally equivalent
to <span class="samp">-Bdynamic</span>.  This option may be used any number of times.

     <p><a name="index-architectures-8"></a><a name="index-_002dA_0040var_007barch_007d-9"></a><br><dt><code>-A</code><var>architecture</var><dd><a name="index-_002d_002darchitecture_003d_0040var_007barch_007d-10"></a><dt><code>--architecture=</code><var>architecture</var><dd>In the current release of <span class="command">ld</span>, this option is useful only for the
Intel 960 family of architectures.  In that <span class="command">ld</span> configuration, the
<var>architecture</var> argument identifies the particular architecture in
the 960 family, enabling some safeguards and modifying the
archive-library search path.  See <a href="i960.html#i960"><span class="command">ld</span> and the Intel 960 family</a>, for details.

     <p>Future releases of <span class="command">ld</span> may support similar functionality for
other architecture families.

     <p><a name="index-binary-input-format-11"></a><a name="index-_002db-_0040var_007bformat_007d-12"></a><a name="index-_002d_002dformat_003d_0040var_007bformat_007d-13"></a><a name="index-input-format-14"></a><a name="index-input-format-15"></a><br><dt><code>-b </code><var>input-format</var><dt><code>--format=</code><var>input-format</var><dd><span class="command">ld</span> may be configured to support more than one kind of object
file.  If your <span class="command">ld</span> is configured this way, you can use the
<span class="samp">-b</span> option to specify the binary format for input object files
that follow this option on the command line.  Even when <span class="command">ld</span> is
configured to support alternative object formats, you don't usually need
to specify this, as <span class="command">ld</span> should be configured to expect as a
default input format the most usual format on each machine. 
<var>input-format</var> is a text string, the name of a particular format
supported by the BFD libraries.  (You can list the available binary
formats with <span class="samp">objdump -i</span>.) 
See <a href="BFD.html#BFD">BFD</a>.

     <p>You may want to use this option if you are linking files with an unusual
binary format.  You can also use <span class="samp">-b</span> to switch formats explicitly (when
linking object files of different formats), by including
<span class="samp">-b </span><var>input-format</var> before each group of object files in a
particular format.

     <p>The default format is taken from the environment variable
<code>GNUTARGET</code>. 
See <a href="Environment.html#Environment">Environment</a>. 
You can also define the input format from a script, using the command
<code>TARGET</code>;
see <a href="Format-Commands.html#Format-Commands">Format Commands</a>.

files written in an alternate, restricted command language, described in
<a href="MRI.html#MRI">MRI Compatible Script Files</a>. 
Introduce MRI script files with
the option <span class="samp">-c</span>; use the <span class="samp">-T</span> option to run linker
scripts written in the general-purpose <span class="command">ld</span> scripting language. 
If <var>MRI-cmdfile</var> does not exist, <span class="command">ld</span> looks for it in the directories
specified by any <span class="samp">-L</span> options.

compatibility with other linkers.  They assign space to common symbols
even if a relocatable output file is specified (with <span class="samp">-r</span>).  The
script command <code>FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION</code> has the same effect. 
See <a href="Miscellaneous-Commands.html#Miscellaneous-Commands">Miscellaneous Commands</a>.

program, rather than the default entry point.  If there is no symbol
named <var>entry</var>, the linker will try to parse <var>entry</var> as a number,
and use that as the entry address (the number will be interpreted in
base 10; you may use a leading <span class="samp">0x</span> for base 16, or a leading
<span class="samp">0</span> for base 8).  See <a href="Entry-Point.html#Entry-Point">Entry Point</a>, for a discussion of defaults
and other ways of specifying the entry point.

     <p><a name="index-_002d_002dexclude_002dlibs-26"></a><br><dt><code>--exclude-libs </code><var>lib</var><code>,</code><var>lib</var><code>,...</code><dd>Specifies a list of archive libraries from which symbols should not be automatically
exported. The library names may be delimited by commas or colons.  Specifying
<code>--exclude-libs ALL</code> excludes symbols in all archive libraries from
automatic export.  This option is available only for the i386 PE targeted
port of the linker and for ELF targeted ports.  For i386 PE, symbols
explicitly listed in a .def file are still exported, regardless of this
option.  For ELF targeted ports, symbols affected by this option will
be treated as hidden.

     <p><a name="index-dynamic-symbol-table-27"></a><a name="index-_002dE-28"></a><a name="index-_002d_002dexport_002ddynamic-29"></a><br><dt><code>-E</code><dt><code>--export-dynamic</code><dd>When creating a dynamically linked executable, add all symbols to the
dynamic symbol table.  The dynamic symbol table is the set of symbols
which are visible from dynamic objects at run time.

     <p>If you do not use this option, the dynamic symbol table will normally
contain only those symbols which are referenced by some dynamic object
mentioned in the link.

     <p>If you use <code>dlopen</code> to load a dynamic object which needs to refer
back to the symbols defined by the program, rather than some other
dynamic object, then you will probably need to use this option when
linking the program itself.

     <p>You can also use the dynamic list to control what symbols should
be added to the dynamic symbol table if the output format supports it. 
See the description of <span class="samp">--dynamic-list</span>.

     <p><a name="index-big_002dendian-objects-30"></a><a name="index-endianness-31"></a><a name="index-_002dEB-32"></a><br><dt><code>-EB</code><dd>Link big-endian objects.  This affects the default output format.

     <p><a name="index-little_002dendian-objects-33"></a><a name="index-_002dEL-34"></a><br><dt><code>-EL</code><dd>Link little-endian objects.  This affects the default output format.

     <p><a name="index-_002df-35"></a><a name="index-_002d_002dauxiliary-36"></a><br><dt><code>-f</code><dt><code>--auxiliary </code><var>name</var><dd>When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_AUXILIARY field
to the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol
table of the shared object should be used as an auxiliary filter on the
symbol table of the shared object <var>name</var>.

     <p>If you later link a program against this filter object, then, when you
run the program, the dynamic linker will see the DT_AUXILIARY field.  If
the dynamic linker resolves any symbols from the filter object, it will
first check whether there is a definition in the shared object
<var>name</var>.  If there is one, it will be used instead of the definition
in the filter object.  The shared object <var>name</var> need not exist. 
Thus the shared object <var>name</var> may be used to provide an alternative
implementation of certain functions, perhaps for debugging or for
machine specific performance.

     <p>This option may be specified more than once.  The DT_AUXILIARY entries
will be created in the order in which they appear on the command line.

     <p><a name="index-_002dF-37"></a><a name="index-_002d_002dfilter-38"></a><br><dt><code>-F </code><var>name</var><dt><code>--filter </code><var>name</var><dd>When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_FILTER field to
the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol table
of the shared object which is being created should be used as a filter
on the symbol table of the shared object <var>name</var>.

     <p>If you later link a program against this filter object, then, when you
run the program, the dynamic linker will see the DT_FILTER field.  The
dynamic linker will resolve symbols according to the symbol table of the
filter object as usual, but it will actually link to the definitions
found in the shared object <var>name</var>.  Thus the filter object can be
used to select a subset of the symbols provided by the object
<var>name</var>.

     <p>Some older linkers used the <span class="option">-F</span> option throughout a compilation
toolchain for specifying object-file format for both input and output
object files. 
The <span class="sc">gnu</span> linker uses other mechanisms for this purpose: the
<span class="option">-b</span>, <span class="option">--format</span>, <span class="option">--oformat</span> options, the
<code>TARGET</code> command in linker scripts, and the <code>GNUTARGET</code>
environment variable. 
The <span class="sc">gnu</span> linker will ignore the <span class="option">-F</span> option when not
creating an ELF shared object.

     <p><a name="index-finalization-function-39"></a><a name="index-_002dfini-40"></a><br><dt><code>-fini </code><var>name</var><dd>When creating an ELF executable or shared object, call NAME when the
executable or shared object is unloaded, by setting DT_FINI to the
address of the function.  By default, the linker uses <code>_fini</code> as
the function to call.

     <p><a name="index-_002dg-41"></a><br><dt><code>-g</code><dd>Ignored.  Provided for compatibility with other tools.

     <p><a name="index-_002dG-42"></a><a name="index-_002d_002dgpsize-43"></a><a name="index-object-size-44"></a><br><dt><code>-G</code><var>value</var><dt><code>--gpsize=</code><var>value</var><dd>Set the maximum size of objects to be optimized using the GP register to
<var>size</var>.  This is only meaningful for object file formats such as
MIPS ECOFF which supports putting large and small objects into different
sections.  This is ignored for other object file formats.

     <p><a name="index-runtime-library-name-45"></a><a name="index-_002dh_0040var_007bname_007d-46"></a><a name="index-_002dsoname_003d_0040var_007bname_007d-47"></a><br><dt><code>-h</code><var>name</var><dt><code>-soname=</code><var>name</var><dd>When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_SONAME field to
the specified name.  When an executable is linked with a shared object
which has a DT_SONAME field, then when the executable is run the dynamic
linker will attempt to load the shared object specified by the DT_SONAME
field rather than the using the file name given to the linker.

     <p><a name="index-_002di-48"></a><a name="index-incremental-link-49"></a><br><dt><code>-i</code><dd>Perform an incremental link (same as option <span class="samp">-r</span>).

     <p><a name="index-initialization-function-50"></a><a name="index-_002dinit-51"></a><br><dt><code>-init </code><var>name</var><dd>When creating an ELF executable or shared object, call NAME when the
executable or shared object is loaded, by setting DT_INIT to the address
of the function.  By default, the linker uses <code>_init</code> as the
function to call.

     <p><a name="index-archive-files_002c-from-cmd-line-52"></a><a name="index-_002dl_0040var_007bnamespec_007d-53"></a><a name="index-_002d_002dlibrary_003d_0040var_007bnamespec_007d-54"></a><br><dt><code>-l</code><var>namespec</var><dt><code>--library=</code><var>namespec</var><dd>Add the archive or object file specified by <var>namespec</var> to the
list of files to link.  This option may be used any number of times. 
If <var>namespec</var> is of the form <span class="file">:</span><var>filename</var>, <span class="command">ld</span>
will search the library path for a file called <var>filename</var>, otherise it
will search the library path for a file called <span class="file">lib</span><var>namespec</var><span class="file">.a</span>.

     <p>On systems which support shared libraries, <span class="command">ld</span> may also search for
files other than <span class="file">lib</span><var>namespec</var><span class="file">.a</span>.  Specifically, on ELF
and SunOS systems, <span class="command">ld</span> will search a directory for a library
called <span class="file">lib</span><var>namespec</var><span class="file">.so</span> before searching for one called
<span class="file">lib</span><var>namespec</var><span class="file">.a</span>.  (By convention, a <code>.so</code> extension
indicates a shared library.)  Note that this behavior does not apply
to <span class="file">:</span><var>filename</var>, which always specifies a file called
<var>filename</var>.

     <p>The linker will search an archive only once, at the location where it is
specified on the command line.  If the archive defines a symbol which
was undefined in some object which appeared before the archive on the
command line, the linker will include the appropriate file(s) from the
archive.  However, an undefined symbol in an object appearing later on
the command line will not cause the linker to search the archive again.

     <p>See the <span class="option">-(</span> option for a way to force the linker to search
archives multiple times.

     <p>You may list the same archive multiple times on the command line.

     <p>This type of archive searching is standard for Unix linkers.  However,
if you are using <span class="command">ld</span> on AIX, note that it is different from the
behaviour of the AIX linker.

     <p><a name="index-search-directory_002c-from-cmd-line-55"></a><a name="index-_002dL_0040var_007bdir_007d-56"></a><a name="index-_002d_002dlibrary_002dpath_003d_0040var_007bdir_007d-57"></a><br><dt><code>-L</code><var>searchdir</var><dt><code>--library-path=</code><var>searchdir</var><dd>Add path <var>searchdir</var> to the list of paths that <span class="command">ld</span> will search

option any number of times.  The directories are searched in the order
in which they are specified on the command line.  Directories specified
on the command line are searched before the default directories.  All
<span class="option">-L</span> options apply to all <span class="option">-l</span> options, regardless of the
order in which the options appear.

     <p>If <var>searchdir</var> begins with <code>=</code>, then the <code>=</code> will be replaced
by the <dfn>sysroot prefix</dfn>, a path specified when the linker is configured.

     <p>The default set of paths searched (without being specified with
<span class="samp">-L</span>) depends on which emulation mode <span class="command">ld</span> is using, and in
some cases also on how it was configured.  See <a href="Environment.html#Environment">Environment</a>.

     <p>The paths can also be specified in a link script with the
<code>SEARCH_DIR</code> command.  Directories specified this way are searched
at the point in which the linker script appears in the command line.

emulations with the <span class="samp">--verbose</span> or <span class="samp">-V</span> options.

     <p>If the <span class="samp">-m</span> option is not used, the emulation is taken from the
<code>LDEMULATION</code> environment variable, if that is defined.

     <p>Otherwise, the default emulation depends upon how the linker was

information about the link, including the following:

          <ul>
<li>Where object files are mapped into memory. 
<li>How common symbols are allocated. 
<li>All archive members included in the link, with a mention of the symbol
which caused the archive member to be brought in. 
<li>The values assigned to symbols.

          <p>Note - symbols whose values are computed by an expression which
involves a reference to a previous value of the same symbol may not
have correct result displayed in the link map.  This is because the
linker discards intermediate results and only retains the final value
of an expression.  Under such circumstances the linker will display
the final value enclosed by square brackets.  Thus for example a
linker script containing:

          <pre class="smallexample">                  foo = 1
                  foo = foo * 4
                  foo = foo + 8
          </pre>
          <p>will produce the following output in the link map if the <span class="option">-M</span>
option is used:

undefined symbols in shared libraries is normal.  (The kernel patches
them at load time to select which function is most appropriate

a symbol definition.  Unix linkers allow this somewhat sloppy practise,
but linkers on some other operating systems do not.  This option allows
you to find potential problems from combining global symbols. 
Unfortunately, some C libraries use this practise, so you may get some
warnings about symbols in the libraries as well as in your programs.

     <p>There are three kinds of global symbols, illustrated here by C examples:

          <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">int i = 1;</span><dd>A definition, which goes in the initialized data section of the output
file.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">extern int i;</span><dd>An undefined reference, which does not allocate space. 
There must be either a definition or a common symbol for the
variable somewhere.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">int i;</span><dd>A common symbol.  If there are only (one or more) common symbols for a
variable, it goes in the uninitialized data area of the output file. 
The linker merges multiple common symbols for the same variable into a
single symbol.  If they are of different sizes, it picks the largest
size.  The linker turns a common symbol into a declaration, if there is
a definition of the same variable. 
</dl>

     <p>The <span class="samp">--warn-common</span> option can produce five kinds of warnings. 
Each warning consists of a pair of lines: the first describes the symbol
just encountered, and the second describes the previous symbol
encountered with the same name.  One or both of the two symbols will be
a common symbol.

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Turning a common symbol into a reference, because there is already a
definition for the symbol.

          </pre>
          <li>Turning a common symbol into a reference, because a later definition for
the symbol is encountered.  This is the same as the previous case,
except that the symbols are encountered in a different order.
          <pre class="smallexample">               <var>file</var>(<var>section</var>): warning: definition of `<var>symbol</var>'

This is only meaningful for certain processors, such as the Alpha. 
Specifically, some processors put large-valued constants in a special
section.  A special register (the global pointer) points into the middle
of this section, so that constants can be loaded efficiently via a
base-register relative addressing mode.  Since the offset in
base-register relative mode is fixed and relatively small (e.g., 16
bits), this limits the maximum size of the constant pool.  Thus, in
large programs, it is often necessary to use multiple global pointer
values in order to be able to address all possible constants.  This
option causes a warning to be issued whenever this case occurs.

     <p>Two notes when using this option from gcc: First, gcc doesn't know
about this option, so you have to use <span class="option">-Wl,-whole-archive</span>. 
Second, don't forget to use <span class="option">-Wl,-no-whole-archive</span> after your

<var>symbol</var>.

     <p>This can be used to provide a wrapper for a system function.  The
wrapper function should be called <code>__wrap_</code><var>symbol</var>.  If it
wishes to call the system function, it should call
<code>__real_</code><var>symbol</var>.

     <p>Here is a trivial example:

     </pre>
     <p>If you link other code with this file using <span class="option">--wrap malloc</span>, then
all calls to <code>malloc</code> will call the function <code>__wrap_malloc</code>
instead.  The call to <code>__real_malloc</code> in <code>__wrap_malloc</code> will
call the real <code>malloc</code> function.

     <p>You may wish to provide a <code>__real_malloc</code> function as well, so that
links without the <span class="option">--wrap</span> option will succeed.  If you do this,
you should not put the definition of <code>__real_malloc</code> in the same
file as <code>__wrap_malloc</code>; if you do, the assembler may resolve the
call before the linker has a chance to wrap it to <code>malloc</code>.

     <p>Another effect of the switch is to set the default hash table size to

<h4 class="subsection">2.1.1 Options Specific to i386 PE Targets</h4>

<!-- man begin OPTIONS -->
<p>The i386 PE linker supports the <span class="option">-shared</span> option, which causes
the output to be a dynamically linked library (DLL) instead of a
normal executable.  You should name the output <code>*.dll</code> when you
use this option.  In addition, the linker fully supports the standard
<code>*.def</code> files, which may be specified on the linker command line
like an object file (in fact, it should precede archives it exports
symbols from, to ensure that they get linked in, just like a normal
object file).

   <p>In addition to the options common to all targets, the i386 PE linker
support additional command line options that are specific to the i386
PE target.  Options that take values may be separated from their
values by either a space or an equals sign.

undefined symbol <code>_foo</code> might be linked to the function
<code>_foo@12</code>, or the undefined symbol <code>_bar@16</code> might be linked
to the function <code>_bar</code>.  When the linker does this, it prints a
warning, since it normally should have failed to link, but sometimes
import libraries generated from third-party dlls may need this feature
to be usable.  If you specify <span class="option">--enable-stdcall-fixup</span>, this

     <p><a name="index-_002d_002denable_002dauto_002dimport-288"></a><br><dt><code>--enable-auto-import</code><dd>Do sophisticated linking of <code>_symbol</code> to <code>__imp__symbol</code> for
DATA imports from DLLs, and create the necessary thunking symbols when
building the import libraries with those DATA exports. Note: Use of the
'auto-import' extension will cause the text section of the image file
to be made writable. This does not conform to the PE-COFF format
specification published by Microsoft.

     <p>Note - use of the 'auto-import' extension will also cause read only
data which would normally be placed into the .rdata section to be
placed into the .data section instead.  This is in order to work
around a problem with consts that is described here:
http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2004-09/msg01101.html

     <p>Using 'auto-import' generally will 'just work' &ndash; but sometimes you may
see this message:

     <p>"variable '&lt;var&gt;' can't be auto-imported. Please read the
documentation for ld's <code>--enable-auto-import</code> for details."

     <p>This message occurs when some (sub)expression accesses an address
ultimately given by the sum of two constants (Win32 import tables only
allow one).  Instances where this may occur include accesses to member
fields of struct variables imported from a DLL, as well as using a
constant index into an array variable imported from a DLL.  Any
multiword variable (arrays, structs, long long, etc) may trigger
this error condition.  However, regardless of the exact data type
of the offending exported variable, ld will always detect it, issue
the warning, and exit.

     <p>There are several ways to address this difficulty, regardless of the
data type of the exported variable:

     <p>One way is to use &ndash;enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc switch. This leaves the task
of adjusting references in your client code for runtime environment, so
this method works only when runtime environment supports this feature.

     <p>A second solution is to force one of the 'constants' to be a variable &ndash;
that is, unknown and un-optimizable at compile time.  For arrays,
there are two possibilities: a) make the indexee (the array's address)
a variable, or b) make the 'constant' index a variable.  Thus:

     <pre class="example">          extern type extern_array[];
          extern_array[1] --&gt;
             { volatile type *t=extern_array; t[1] }
     </pre>
     <p>or

     <pre class="example">          extern type extern_array[];
          extern_array[1] --&gt;
             { volatile int t=1; extern_array[t] }
     </pre>
     <p>For structs (and most other multiword data types) the only option
is to make the struct itself (or the long long, or the ...) variable:

     <pre class="example">          extern struct s extern_struct;
          extern_struct.field --&gt;
             { volatile struct s *t=&amp;extern_struct; t-&gt;field }
     </pre>
     <p>or

     <pre class="example">          extern long long extern_ll;
          extern_ll --&gt;
            { volatile long long * local_ll=&amp;extern_ll; *local_ll }
     </pre>
     <p>A third method of dealing with this difficulty is to abandon
'auto-import' for the offending symbol and mark it with
<code>__declspec(dllimport)</code>.  However, in practise that
requires using compile-time #defines to indicate whether you are
building a DLL, building client code that will link to the DLL, or
merely building/linking to a static library.   In making the choice
between the various methods of resolving the 'direct address with
constant offset' problem, you should consider typical real-world usage:

     <p>Original:
     <pre class="example">          --foo.h
          extern int arr[];
          --foo.c
          #include "foo.h"
          void main(int argc, char **argv){
            printf("%d\n",arr[1]);
          }
     </pre>
     <p>Solution 1:
     <pre class="example">          --foo.h
          extern int arr[];
          --foo.c
          #include "foo.h"
          void main(int argc, char **argv){
            /* This workaround is for win32 and cygwin; do not "optimize" */
            volatile int *parr = arr;
            printf("%d\n",parr[1]);
          }
     </pre>
     <p>Solution 2:
     <pre class="example">          --foo.h
          /* Note: auto-export is assumed (no __declspec(dllexport)) */
          #if (defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN__)) &amp;&amp; \
            !(defined(FOO_BUILD_DLL) || defined(FOO_STATIC))
          #define FOO_IMPORT __declspec(dllimport)
          #else
          #define FOO_IMPORT
          #endif
          extern FOO_IMPORT int arr[];
          --foo.c
          #include "foo.h"
          void main(int argc, char **argv){
            printf("%d\n",arr[1]);
          }
     </pre>
     <p>A fourth way to avoid this problem is to re-code your
library to use a functional interface rather than a data interface
for the offending variables (e.g. set_foo() and get_foo() accessor
functions).
