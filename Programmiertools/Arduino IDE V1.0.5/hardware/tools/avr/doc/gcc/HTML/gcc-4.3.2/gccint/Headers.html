<h4 class="subsection">6.3.6 Headers Installed by GCC</h4>

<p>In general, GCC expects the system C library to provide most of the
headers to be used with it.  However, GCC will fix those headers if
necessary to make them work with GCC, and will install some headers
required of freestanding implementations.  These headers are installed
in <var>libsubdir</var><span class="file">/include</span>.  Headers for non-C runtime
libraries are also installed by GCC; these are not documented here. 
(FIXME: document them somewhere.)

 <p>Several of the headers GCC installs are in the <span class="file">ginclude</span>
directory.  These headers, <span class="file">iso646.h</span>,
<span class="file">stdarg.h</span>, <span class="file">stdbool.h</span>, and <span class="file">stddef.h</span>,
are installed in <var>libsubdir</var><span class="file">/include</span>,
unless the target Makefile fragment (see <a href="Target-Fragment.html#Target-Fragment">Target Fragment</a>)
overrides this by setting <code>USER_H</code>.

 <p>In addition to these headers and those generated by fixing system
headers to work with GCC, some other headers may also be installed in
<var>libsubdir</var><span class="file">/include</span>.  <span class="file">config.gcc</span> may set
<code>extra_headers</code>; this specifies additional headers under
<span class="file">config</span> to be installed on some systems.

 <p>GCC installs its own version of <code>&lt;float.h&gt;</code>, from <span class="file">ginclude/float.h</span>. 
This is done to cope with command-line options that change the
representation of floating point numbers.

 <p>GCC also installs its own version of <code>&lt;limits.h&gt;</code>; this is generated
from <span class="file">glimits.h</span>, together with <span class="file">limitx.h</span> and
<span class="file">limity.h</span> if the system also has its own version of
<code>&lt;limits.h&gt;</code>.  (GCC provides its own header because it is
required of ISO C freestanding implementations, but needs to include
the system header from its own header as well because other standards
such as POSIX specify additional values to be defined in
<code>&lt;limits.h&gt;</code>.)  The system's <code>&lt;limits.h&gt;</code> header is used via
<var>libsubdir</var><span class="file">/include/syslimits.h</span>, which is copied from
<span class="file">gsyslimits.h</span> if it does not need fixing to work with GCC; if it
needs fixing, <span class="file">syslimits.h</span> is the fixed copy.

 <p>GCC can also install <code>&lt;tgmath.h&gt;</code>.  It will do this when
<span class="file">config.gcc</span> sets <code>use_gcc_tgmath</code> to <code>yes</code>.
