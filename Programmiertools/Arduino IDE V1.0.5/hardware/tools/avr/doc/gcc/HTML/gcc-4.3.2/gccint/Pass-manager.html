<h3 class="section">8.3 Pass manager</h3>

<p>The pass manager is located in <span class="file">passes.c</span>, <span class="file">tree-optimize.c</span>
and <span class="file">tree-pass.h</span>. 
Its job is to run all of the individual passes in the correct order,
and take care of standard bookkeeping that applies to every pass.

 <p>The theory of operation is that each pass defines a structure that
represents everything we need to know about that pass&mdash;when it
should be run, how it should be run, what intermediate language
form or on-the-side data structures it needs.  We register the pass
to be run in some particular order, and the pass manager arranges
for everything to happen in the correct order.

 <p>The actuality doesn't completely live up to the theory at present. 
Command-line switches and <code>timevar_id_t</code> enumerations must still
be defined elsewhere.  The pass manager validates constraints but does
not attempt to (re-)generate data structures or lower intermediate
language form based on the requirements of the next pass.  Nevertheless,
what is present is useful, and a far sight better than nothing at all.

 <p>TODO: describe the global variables set up by the pass manager,
and a brief description of how a new pass should use it. 
I need to look at what info rtl passes use first<small class="enddots">....</small>
