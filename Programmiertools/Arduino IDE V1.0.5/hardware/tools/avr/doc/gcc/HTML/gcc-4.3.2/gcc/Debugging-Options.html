<h3 class="section">3.9 Options for Debugging Your Program or GCC</h3>

<p><a name="index-options_002c-debugging-453"></a><a name="index-debugging-information-options-454"></a>
GCC has various special options that are used for debugging
either your program or GCC:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-g</code><dd><a name="index-g-455"></a>Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format
(stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF 2).  GDB can work with this debugging
information.

     <p>On most systems that use stabs format, <span class="option">-g</span> enables use of extra
debugging information that only GDB can use; this extra information
makes debugging work better in GDB but will probably make other debuggers
crash or
refuse to read the program.  If you want to control for certain whether
to generate the extra information, use <span class="option">-gstabs+</span>, <span class="option">-gstabs</span>,
<span class="option">-gxcoff+</span>, <span class="option">-gxcoff</span>, or <span class="option">-gvms</span> (see below).

     <p>GCC allows you to use <span class="option">-g</span> with
<span class="option">-O</span>.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
produce surprising results: some variables you declared may not exist
at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values were already at hand; some statements may
execute in different places because they were moved out of loops.

     <p>Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This makes
it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.

     <p>The following options are useful when GCC is generated with the
capability for more than one debugging format.

     <br><dt><code>-ggdb</code><dd><a name="index-ggdb-456"></a>Produce debugging information for use by GDB.  This means to use the
most expressive format available (DWARF 2, stabs, or the native format
if neither of those are supported), including GDB extensions if at all
possible.

     <br><dt><code>-gstabs</code><dd><a name="index-gstabs-457"></a>Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
without GDB extensions.  This is the format used by DBX on most BSD
systems.  On MIPS, Alpha and System V Release 4 systems this option
produces stabs debugging output which is not understood by DBX or SDB. 
On System V Release 4 systems this option requires the GNU assembler.

     <br><dt><code>-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols</code><dd><a name="index-feliminate_002dunused_002ddebug_002dsymbols-458"></a>Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
for only symbols that are actually used.

     <br><dt><code>-femit-class-debug-always</code><dd>Instead of emitting debugging information for a C++ class in only one
object file, emit it in all object files using the class.  This option
should be used only with debuggers that are unable to handle the way GCC
normally emits debugging information for classes because using this
option will increase the size of debugging information by as much as a
factor of two.

     <br><dt><code>-gstabs+</code><dd><a name="index-gstabs_002b-459"></a>Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program.

     <br><dt><code>-gcoff</code><dd><a name="index-gcoff-460"></a>Produce debugging information in COFF format (if that is supported). 
This is the format used by SDB on most System V systems prior to
System V Release 4.

     <br><dt><code>-gxcoff</code><dd><a name="index-gxcoff-461"></a>Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is supported). 
This is the format used by the DBX debugger on IBM RS/6000 systems.

     <br><dt><code>-gxcoff+</code><dd><a name="index-gxcoff_002b-462"></a>Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is supported),
using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program, and may cause assemblers other than the GNU
assembler (GAS) to fail with an error.

     <br><dt><code>-gdwarf-2</code><dd><a name="index-gdwarf_002d2-463"></a>Produce debugging information in DWARF version 2 format (if that is
supported).  This is the format used by DBX on IRIX 6.  With this
option, GCC uses features of DWARF version 3 when they are useful;
version 3 is upward compatible with version 2, but may still cause
problems for older debuggers.

     <br><dt><code>-gvms</code><dd><a name="index-gvms-464"></a>Produce debugging information in VMS debug format (if that is
supported).  This is the format used by DEBUG on VMS systems.

     <br><dt><code>-g</code><var>level</var><dt><code>-ggdb</code><var>level</var><dt><code>-gstabs</code><var>level</var><dt><code>-gcoff</code><var>level</var><dt><code>-gxcoff</code><var>level</var><dt><code>-gvms</code><var>level</var><dd>Request debugging information and also use <var>level</var> to specify how
much information.  The default level is 2.

     <p>Level 0 produces no debug information at all.  Thus, <span class="option">-g0</span> negates
<span class="option">-g</span>.

     <p>Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in
parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This includes
descriptions of functions and external variables, but no information
about local variables and no line numbers.

     <p>Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions
present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro expansion when
you use <span class="option">-g3</span>.

     <p><span class="option">-gdwarf-2</span> does not accept a concatenated debug level, because
GCC used to support an option <span class="option">-gdwarf</span> that meant to generate
debug information in version 1 of the DWARF format (which is very
different from version 2), and it would have been too confusing.  That
debug format is long obsolete, but the option cannot be changed now. 
Instead use an additional <span class="option">-g</span><var>level</var> option to change the
debug level for DWARF2.

     <br><dt><code>-feliminate-dwarf2-dups</code><dd><a name="index-feliminate_002ddwarf2_002ddups-465"></a>Compress DWARF2 debugging information by eliminating duplicated
information about each symbol.  This option only makes sense when
generating DWARF2 debugging information with <span class="option">-gdwarf-2</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-femit-struct-debug-baseonly</code><dd>Emit debug information for struct-like types
only when the base name of the compilation source file
matches the base name of file in which the struct was defined.

     <p>This option substantially reduces the size of debugging information,
but at significant potential loss in type information to the debugger. 
See <span class="option">-femit-struct-debug-reduced</span> for a less aggressive option. 
See <span class="option">-femit-struct-debug-detailed</span> for more detailed control.

     <p>This option works only with DWARF 2.

     <br><dt><code>-femit-struct-debug-reduced</code><dd>Emit debug information for struct-like types
only when the base name of the compilation source file
matches the base name of file in which the type was defined,
unless the struct is a template or defined in a system header.

     <p>This option significantly reduces the size of debugging information,
with some potential loss in type information to the debugger. 
See <span class="option">-femit-struct-debug-baseonly</span> for a more aggressive option. 
See <span class="option">-femit-struct-debug-detailed</span> for more detailed control.

     <p>This option works only with DWARF 2.

     <br><dt><code>-femit-struct-debug-detailed</code><span class="roman">[</span><code>=</code><var>spec-list</var><span class="roman">]</span><dd>Specify the struct-like types
for which the compiler will generate debug information. 
The intent is to reduce duplicate struct debug information
between different object files within the same program.

     <p>This option is a detailed version of
<span class="option">-femit-struct-debug-reduced</span> and <span class="option">-femit-struct-debug-baseonly</span>,
which will serve for most needs.

     <p>A specification has the syntax
[<span class="samp">dir:</span>|<span class="samp">ind:</span>][<span class="samp">ord:</span>|<span class="samp">gen:</span>](<span class="samp">any</span>|<span class="samp">sys</span>|<span class="samp">base</span>|<span class="samp">none</span>)

     <p>The optional first word limits the specification to
structs that are used directly (<span class="samp">dir:</span>) or used indirectly (<span class="samp">ind:</span>). 
A struct type is used directly when it is the type of a variable, member. 
Indirect uses arise through pointers to structs. 
That is, when use of an incomplete struct would be legal, the use is indirect. 
An example is
<span class="samp">struct one direct; struct two * indirect;</span>.

     <p>The optional second word limits the specification to
ordinary structs (<span class="samp">ord:</span>) or generic structs (<span class="samp">gen:</span>). 
Generic structs are a bit complicated to explain. 
For C++, these are non-explicit specializations of template classes,
or non-template classes within the above. 
Other programming languages have generics,
but <span class="samp">-femit-struct-debug-detailed</span> does not yet implement them.

     <p>The third word specifies the source files for those
structs for which the compiler will emit debug information. 
The values <span class="samp">none</span> and <span class="samp">any</span> have the normal meaning. 
The value <span class="samp">base</span> means that
the base of name of the file in which the type declaration appears
must match the base of the name of the main compilation file. 
In practice, this means that
types declared in <span class="file">foo.c</span> and <span class="file">foo.h</span> will have debug information,
but types declared in other header will not. 
The value <span class="samp">sys</span> means those types satisfying <span class="samp">base</span>
or declared in system or compiler headers.

     <p>You may need to experiment to determine the best settings for your application.

     <p>The default is <span class="samp">-femit-struct-debug-detailed=all</span>.

     <p>This option works only with DWARF 2.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-merge-debug-strings</code><dd><a name="index-fmerge_002ddebug_002dstrings-466"></a><a name="index-fno_002dmerge_002ddebug_002dstrings-467"></a>Direct the linker to merge together strings which are identical in
different object files.  This is not supported by all assemblers or
linker.  This decreases the size of the debug information in the
output file at the cost of increasing link processing time.  This is
on by default.

     <br><dt><code>-fdebug-prefix-map=</code><var>old</var><code>=</code><var>new</var><dd><a name="index-fdebug_002dprefix_002dmap-468"></a>When compiling files in directory <var>old</var>, record debugging
information describing them as in <var>new</var> instead.

     <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bprof_007d-469"></a><br><dt><code>-p</code><dd><a name="index-p-470"></a>Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program <span class="command">prof</span>.  You must use this option when compiling
the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
linking.

     <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bgprof_007d-471"></a><br><dt><code>-pg</code><dd><a name="index-pg-472"></a>Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program <span class="command">gprof</span>.  You must use this option when compiling
the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
linking.

     <br><dt><code>-Q</code><dd><a name="index-Q-473"></a>Makes the compiler print out each function name as it is compiled, and
print some statistics about each pass when it finishes.

     <br><dt><code>-ftime-report</code><dd><a name="index-ftime_002dreport-474"></a>Makes the compiler print some statistics about the time consumed by each
pass when it finishes.

     <br><dt><code>-fmem-report</code><dd><a name="index-fmem_002dreport-475"></a>Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory
allocation when it finishes.

     <br><dt><code>-fpre-ipa-mem-report</code><dd><a name="index-fpre_002dipa_002dmem_002dreport-476"></a><br><dt><code>-fpost-ipa-mem-report</code><dd><a name="index-fpost_002dipa_002dmem_002dreport-477"></a>Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory
allocation before or after interprocedural optimization.

     <br><dt><code>-fprofile-arcs</code><dd><a name="index-fprofile_002darcs-478"></a>Add code so that program flow <dfn>arcs</dfn> are instrumented.  During
execution the program records how many times each branch and call is
executed and how many times it is taken or returns.  When the compiled
program exits it saves this data to a file called
<var>auxname</var><span class="file">.gcda</span> for each source file.  The data may be used for
profile-directed optimizations (<span class="option">-fbranch-probabilities</span>), or for
test coverage analysis (<span class="option">-ftest-coverage</span>).  Each object file's
<var>auxname</var> is generated from the name of the output file, if
explicitly specified and it is not the final executable, otherwise it is
the basename of the source file.  In both cases any suffix is removed
(e.g. <span class="file">foo.gcda</span> for input file <span class="file">dir/foo.c</span>, or
<span class="file">dir/foo.gcda</span> for output file specified as <span class="option">-o dir/foo.o</span>). 
See <a href="Cross_002dprofiling.html#Cross_002dprofiling">Cross-profiling</a>.

     <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bgcov_007d-479"></a><br><dt><code>--coverage</code><dd><a name="index-coverage-480"></a>
This option is used to compile and link code instrumented for coverage
analysis.  The option is a synonym for <span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span>
<span class="option">-ftest-coverage</span> (when compiling) and <span class="option">-lgcov</span> (when
linking).  See the documentation for those options for more details.

          <ul>
<li>Compile the source files with <span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span> plus optimization
and code generation options.  For test coverage analysis, use the
additional <span class="option">-ftest-coverage</span> option.  You do not need to profile
every source file in a program.

          <li>Link your object files with <span class="option">-lgcov</span> or <span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span>
(the latter implies the former).

          <li>Run the program on a representative workload to generate the arc profile
information.  This may be repeated any number of times.  You can run
concurrent instances of your program, and provided that the file system
supports locking, the data files will be correctly updated.  Also
<code>fork</code> calls are detected and correctly handled (double counting
will not happen).

          <li>For profile-directed optimizations, compile the source files again with
the same optimization and code generation options plus
<span class="option">-fbranch-probabilities</span> (see <a href="Optimize-Options.html#Optimize-Options">Options that Control Optimization</a>).

          <li>For test coverage analysis, use <span class="command">gcov</span> to produce human readable
information from the <span class="file">.gcno</span> and <span class="file">.gcda</span> files.  Refer to the
<span class="command">gcov</span> documentation for further information.

     </ul>

     <p>With <span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span>, for each function of your program GCC
creates a program flow graph, then finds a spanning tree for the graph. 
Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree have to be instrumented: the
compiler adds code to count the number of times that these arcs are
executed.  When an arc is the only exit or only entrance to a block, the
instrumentation code can be added to the block; otherwise, a new basic
block must be created to hold the instrumentation code.

     <br><dt><code>-ftest-coverage</code><dd><a name="index-ftest_002dcoverage-481"></a>Produce a notes file that the <span class="command">gcov</span> code-coverage utility
(see <a href="Gcov.html#Gcov"><span class="command">gcov</span>&mdash;a Test Coverage Program</a>) can use to
show program coverage.  Each source file's note file is called
<var>auxname</var><span class="file">.gcno</span>.  Refer to the <span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span> option
above for a description of <var>auxname</var> and instructions on how to
generate test coverage data.  Coverage data will match the source files
more closely, if you do not optimize.

     <br><dt><code>-fdbg-cnt-list</code><dd><a name="index-fdbg_002dcnt_002dlist-482"></a>Print the name and the counter upperbound for all debug counters.

     <br><dt><code>-fdbg-cnt=</code><var>counter-value-list</var><dd><a name="index-fdbg_002dcnt-483"></a>Set the internal debug counter upperbound. <var>counter-value-list</var>
is a comma-separated list of <var>name</var>:<var>value</var> pairs
which sets the upperbound of each debug counter <var>name</var> to <var>value</var>. 
All debug counters have the initial upperbound of <var>UINT_MAX</var>,
thus dbg_cnt() returns true always unless the upperbound is set by this option. 
e.g. With -fdbg-cnt=dce:10,tail_call:0
dbg_cnt(dce) will return true only for first 10 invocations
and dbg_cnt(tail_call) will return false always.

     <br><dt><code>-d</code><var>letters</var><br><dt><code>-fdump-rtl-</code><var>pass</var><dd><a name="index-d-484"></a>Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times specified by
<var>letters</var>.    This is used for debugging the RTL-based passes of the
compiler.  The file names for most of the dumps are made by appending a
pass number and a word to the <var>dumpname</var>.  <var>dumpname</var> is generated
from the name of the output file, if explicitly specified and it is not
an executable, otherwise it is the basename of the source file. These
switches may have different effects when <span class="option">-E</span> is used for
preprocessing.

     <p>Most debug dumps can be enabled either passing a letter to the <span class="option">-d</span>
option, or with a long <span class="option">-fdump-rtl</span> switch; here are the possible
letters for use in <var>letters</var> and <var>pass</var>, and their meanings:

If <var>n</var>=6, the vectorizer reports also non-vectorized nested loops.

compiling <span class="file">foo.c</span> with <span class="samp">-c -save-temps</span> would produce files
<span class="file">foo.i</span> and <span class="file">foo.s</span>, as well as <span class="file">foo.o</span>.  This creates a
preprocessed <span class="file">foo.i</span> output file even though the compiler now
normally uses an integrated preprocessor.

     <p>When used in combination with the <span class="option">-x</span> command line option,
<span class="option">-save-temps</span> is sensible enough to avoid over writing an
input source file with the same extension as an intermediate file. 
The corresponding intermediate file may be obtained by renaming the
source file before using <span class="option">-save-temps</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-time</code><dd><a name="index-time-595"></a>Report the CPU time taken by each subprocess in the compilation
sequence.  For C source files, this is the compiler proper and assembler
(plus the linker if linking is done).  The output looks like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          # cc1 0.12 0.01
          # as 0.00 0.01
     </pre>
     <p>The first number on each line is the &ldquo;user time&rdquo;, that is time spent
executing the program itself.  The second number is &ldquo;system time&rdquo;,
time spent executing operating system routines on behalf of the program. 
Both numbers are in seconds.

     <br><dt><code>-fvar-tracking</code><dd><a name="index-fvar_002dtracking-596"></a>Run variable tracking pass.  It computes where variables are stored at each
position in code.  Better debugging information is then generated
(if the debugging information format supports this information).

     <p>It is enabled by default when compiling with optimization (<span class="option">-Os</span>,
<span class="option">-O</span>, <span class="option">-O2</span>, <small class="dots">...</small>), debugging information (<span class="option">-g</span>) and
the debug info format supports it.

     <br><dt><code>-print-file-name=</code><var>library</var><dd><a name="index-print_002dfile_002dname-597"></a>Print the full absolute name of the library file <var>library</var> that
would be used when linking&mdash;and don't do anything else.  With this
option, GCC does not compile or link anything; it just prints the
file name.

     <br><dt><code>-print-multi-directory</code><dd><a name="index-print_002dmulti_002ddirectory-598"></a>Print the directory name corresponding to the multilib selected by any
other switches present in the command line.  This directory is supposed
to exist in <span class="env">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-print-multi-lib</code><dd><a name="index-print_002dmulti_002dlib-599"></a>Print the mapping from multilib directory names to compiler switches
that enable them.  The directory name is separated from the switches by
<span class="samp">;</span>, and each switch starts with an <span class="samp">@</span> instead of the
<span class="samp">-</span>, without spaces between multiple switches.  This is supposed to
ease shell-processing.

     <br><dt><code>-print-prog-name=</code><var>program</var><dd><a name="index-print_002dprog_002dname-600"></a>Like <span class="option">-print-file-name</span>, but searches for a program such as <span class="samp">cpp</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-print-libgcc-file-name</code><dd><a name="index-print_002dlibgcc_002dfile_002dname-601"></a>Same as <span class="option">-print-file-name=libgcc.a</span>.

     <p>This is useful when you use <span class="option">-nostdlib</span> or <span class="option">-nodefaultlibs</span>
but you do want to link with <span class="file">libgcc.a</span>.  You can do

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -nostdlib <var>files</var>... `gcc -print-libgcc-file-name`
     </pre>
     <br><dt><code>-print-search-dirs</code><dd><a name="index-print_002dsearch_002ddirs-602"></a>Print the name of the configured installation directory and a list of
program and library directories <span class="command">gcc</span> will search&mdash;and don't do anything else.

     <p>This is useful when <span class="command">gcc</span> prints the error message
<span class="samp">installation problem, cannot exec cpp0: No such file or directory</span>. 
To resolve this you either need to put <span class="file">cpp0</span> and the other compiler
components where <span class="command">gcc</span> expects to find them, or you can set the environment
variable <span class="env">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</span> to the directory where you installed them. 
Don't forget the trailing <span class="samp">/</span>. 
See <a href="Environment-Variables.html#Environment-Variables">Environment Variables</a>.

     <br><dt><code>-print-sysroot-headers-suffix</code><dd><a name="index-print_002dsysroot_002dheaders_002dsuffix-603"></a>Print the suffix added to the target sysroot when searching for
headers, or give an error if the compiler is not configured with such
a suffix&mdash;and don't do anything else.

     <br><dt><code>-dumpmachine</code><dd><a name="index-dumpmachine-604"></a>Print the compiler's target machine (for example,
<span class="samp">i686-pc-linux-gnu</span>)&mdash;and don't do anything else.

     <br><dt><code>-dumpversion</code><dd><a name="index-dumpversion-605"></a>Print the compiler version (for example, <span class="samp">3.0</span>)&mdash;and don't do
anything else.

     <br><dt><code>-dumpspecs</code><dd><a name="index-dumpspecs-606"></a>Print the compiler's built-in specs&mdash;and don't do anything else.  (This
is used when GCC itself is being built.)  See <a href="Spec-Files.html#Spec-Files">Spec Files</a>.

     <br><dt><code>-feliminate-unused-debug-types</code><dd><a name="index-feliminate_002dunused_002ddebug_002dtypes-607"></a>Normally, when producing DWARF2 output, GCC will emit debugging
information for all types declared in a compilation
unit, regardless of whether or not they are actually used
in that compilation unit.  Sometimes this is useful, such as
if, in the debugger, you want to cast a value to a type that is
not actually used in your program (but is declared).  More often,
however, this results in a significant amount of wasted space. 
With this option, GCC will avoid producing debug symbol output
for types that are nowhere used in the source file being compiled.
