<h4 class="subsection">3.7.2 Common Predefined Macros</h4>

<p><a name="index-common-predefined-macros-60"></a>
The common predefined macros are GNU C extensions.  They are available
with the same meanings regardless of the machine or operating system on
which you are using GNU C or GNU Fortran.  Their names all start with
double underscores.

     <dl>
<dt><code>__COUNTER__</code><dd>This macro expands to sequential integral values starting from 0.  In
conjunction with the <code>##</code> operator, this provides a convenient means to
generate unique identifiers.  Care must be taken to ensure that
<code>__COUNTER__</code> is not expanded prior to inclusion of precompiled headers
which use it.  Otherwise, the precompiled headers will not be used.

     <br><dt><code>__GFORTRAN__</code><dd>The GNU Fortran compiler defines this.

     <br><dt><code>__GNUC__</code><dt><code>__GNUC_MINOR__</code><dt><code>__GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__</code><dd>These macros are defined by all GNU compilers that use the C
preprocessor: C, C++, Objective-C and Fortran.  Their values are the major
version, minor version, and patch level of the compiler, as integer
constants.  For example, GCC 3.2.1 will define <code>__GNUC__</code> to 3,
<code>__GNUC_MINOR__</code> to 2, and <code>__GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__</code> to 1.  These
macros are also defined if you invoke the preprocessor directly.

     <p><code>__GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__</code> is new to GCC 3.0; it is also present in the
widely-used development snapshots leading up to 3.0 (which identify
themselves as GCC 2.96 or 2.97, depending on which snapshot you have).

     <p>If all you need to know is whether or not your program is being compiled
by GCC, or a non-GCC compiler that claims to accept the GNU C dialects,
you can simply test <code>__GNUC__</code>.  If you need to write code
which depends on a specific version, you must be more careful.  Each
time the minor version is increased, the patch level is reset to zero;
each time the major version is increased (which happens rarely), the
minor version and patch level are reset.  If you wish to use the
predefined macros directly in the conditional, you will need to write it
like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          /* <span class="roman">Test for GCC &gt; 3.2.0</span> */
          #if __GNUC__ &gt; 3 || \
              (__GNUC__ == 3 &amp;&amp; (__GNUC_MINOR__ &gt; 2 || \
                                 (__GNUC_MINOR__ == 2 &amp;&amp; \
                                  __GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__ &gt; 0))
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">Another approach is to use the predefined macros to
calculate a single number, then compare that against a threshold:

     <pre class="smallexample">          #define GCC_VERSION (__GNUC__ * 10000 \
                               + __GNUC_MINOR__ * 100 \
                               + __GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__)
          ...
          /* <span class="roman">Test for GCC &gt; 3.2.0</span> */
          #if GCC_VERSION &gt; 30200
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">Many people find this form easier to understand.

     <br><dt><code>__GNUG__</code><dd>The GNU C++ compiler defines this.  Testing it is equivalent to
testing <code>(__GNUC__&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;__cplusplus)<!-- /@w --></code>.

     <br><dt><code>__STRICT_ANSI__</code><dd>GCC defines this macro if and only if the <span class="option">-ansi</span> switch, or a
<span class="option">-std</span> switch specifying strict conformance to some version of ISO C,
was specified when GCC was invoked.  It is defined to <span class="samp">1</span>. 
This macro exists primarily to direct GNU libc's header files to
restrict their definitions to the minimal set found in the 1989 C
standard.

     <br><dt><code>__BASE_FILE__</code><dd>This macro expands to the name of the main input file, in the form
of a C string constant.  This is the source file that was specified
on the command line of the preprocessor or C compiler.

     <br><dt><code>__INCLUDE_LEVEL__</code><dd>This macro expands to a decimal integer constant that represents the
depth of nesting in include files.  The value of this macro is
incremented on every <span class="samp">#include</span> directive and decremented at the
end of every included file.  It starts out at 0, its value within the
base file specified on the command line.

     <br><dt><code>__ELF__</code><dd>This macro is defined if the target uses the ELF object format.

     <br><dt><code>__VERSION__</code><dd>This macro expands to a string constant which describes the version of
the compiler in use.  You should not rely on its contents having any
particular form, but it can be counted on to contain at least the
release number.

     <br><dt><code>__OPTIMIZE__</code><dt><code>__OPTIMIZE_SIZE__</code><dt><code>__NO_INLINE__</code><dd>These macros describe the compilation mode.  <code>__OPTIMIZE__</code> is
defined in all optimizing compilations.  <code>__OPTIMIZE_SIZE__</code> is
defined if the compiler is optimizing for size, not speed. 
<code>__NO_INLINE__</code> is defined if no functions will be inlined into
their callers (when not optimizing, or when inlining has been
specifically disabled by <span class="option">-fno-inline</span>).

     <p>These macros cause certain GNU header files to provide optimized
definitions, using macros or inline functions, of system library
functions.  You should not use these macros in any way unless you make
sure that programs will execute with the same effect whether or not they
are defined.  If they are defined, their value is 1.

     <br><dt><code>__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__</code><dd>GCC defines this macro if functions declared <code>inline</code> will be
handled in GCC's traditional gnu89 mode.  Object files will contain
externally visible definitions of all functions declared <code>inline</code>
without <code>extern</code> or <code>static</code>.  They will not contain any
definitions of any functions declared <code>extern inline</code>.

     <br><dt><code>__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__</code><dd>GCC defines this macro if functions declared <code>inline</code> will be
handled according to the ISO C99 standard.  Object files will contain
externally visible definitions of all functions declared <code>extern
inline</code>.  They will not contain definitions of any functions declared
<code>inline</code> without <code>extern</code>.

     <p>If this macro is defined, GCC supports the <code>gnu_inline</code> function
attribute as a way to always get the gnu89 behavior.  Support for
this and <code>__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__</code> was added in GCC 4.1.3.  If
neither macro is defined, an older version of GCC is being used:
<code>inline</code> functions will be compiled in gnu89 mode, and the
<code>gnu_inline</code> function attribute will not be recognized.

     <br><dt><code>__CHAR_UNSIGNED__</code><dd>GCC defines this macro if and only if the data type <code>char</code> is
unsigned on the target machine.  It exists to cause the standard header
file <span class="file">limits.h</span> to work correctly.  You should not use this macro
yourself; instead, refer to the standard macros defined in <span class="file">limits.h</span>.

     <br><dt><code>__WCHAR_UNSIGNED__</code><dd>Like <code>__CHAR_UNSIGNED__</code>, this macro is defined if and only if the
data type <code>wchar_t</code> is unsigned and the front-end is in C++ mode.

     <br><dt><code>__REGISTER_PREFIX__</code><dd>This macro expands to a single token (not a string constant) which is
the prefix applied to CPU register names in assembly language for this
target.  You can use it to write assembly that is usable in multiple
environments.  For example, in the <code>m68k-aout</code> environment it
expands to nothing, but in the <code>m68k-coff</code> environment it expands
to a single <span class="samp">%</span>.

     <br><dt><code>__USER_LABEL_PREFIX__</code><dd>This macro expands to a single token which is the prefix applied to
user labels (symbols visible to C code) in assembly.  For example, in
the <code>m68k-aout</code> environment it expands to an <span class="samp">_</span>, but in the
<code>m68k-coff</code> environment it expands to nothing.

     <p>This macro will have the correct definition even if
<span class="option">-f(no-)underscores</span> is in use, but it will not be correct if
target-specific options that adjust this prefix are used (e.g. the
OSF/rose <span class="option">-mno-underscores</span> option).

     <br><dt><code>__SIZE_TYPE__</code><dt><code>__PTRDIFF_TYPE__</code><dt><code>__WCHAR_TYPE__</code><dt><code>__WINT_TYPE__</code><dt><code>__INTMAX_TYPE__</code><dt><code>__UINTMAX_TYPE__</code><dd>These macros are defined to the correct underlying types for the
<code>size_t</code>, <code>ptrdiff_t</code>, <code>wchar_t</code>, <code>wint_t</code>,
<code>intmax_t</code>, and <code>uintmax_t</code>
typedefs, respectively.  They exist to make the standard header files
<span class="file">stddef.h</span> and <span class="file">wchar.h</span> work correctly.  You should not use
these macros directly; instead, include the appropriate headers and use
the typedefs.

     <br><dt><code>__CHAR_BIT__</code><dd>Defined to the number of bits used in the representation of the
<code>char</code> data type.  It exists to make the standard header given
numerical limits work correctly.  You should not use
this macro directly; instead, include the appropriate headers.

     <br><dt><code>__SCHAR_MAX__</code><dt><code>__WCHAR_MAX__</code><dt><code>__SHRT_MAX__</code><dt><code>__INT_MAX__</code><dt><code>__LONG_MAX__</code><dt><code>__LONG_LONG_MAX__</code><dt><code>__INTMAX_MAX__</code><dd>Defined to the maximum value of the <code>signed char</code>, <code>wchar_t</code>,
<code>signed short</code>,
<code>signed int</code>, <code>signed long</code>, <code>signed long long</code>, and
<code>intmax_t</code> types
respectively.  They exist to make the standard header given numerical limits
work correctly.  You should not use these macros directly; instead, include
the appropriate headers.

     <br><dt><code>__SIZEOF_INT__</code><dt><code>__SIZEOF_LONG__</code><dt><code>__SIZEOF_LONG_LONG__</code><dt><code>__SIZEOF_SHORT__</code><dt><code>__SIZEOF_POINTER__</code><dt><code>__SIZEOF_FLOAT__</code><dt><code>__SIZEOF_DOUBLE__</code><dt><code>__SIZEOF_LONG_DOUBLE__</code><dt><code>__SIZEOF_SIZE_T__</code><dt><code>__SIZEOF_WCHAR_T__</code><dt><code>__SIZEOF_WINT_T__</code><dt><code>__SIZEOF_PTRDIFF_T__</code><dd>Defined to the number of bytes of the C standard data types: <code>int</code>,
<code>long</code>, <code>long long</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>void *</code>, <code>float</code>,
<code>double</code>, <code>long double</code>, <code>size_t</code>, <code>wchar_t</code>, <code>wint_t</code>
and <code>ptrdiff_t</code>.

     <br><dt><code>__DEPRECATED</code><dd>This macro is defined, with value 1, when compiling a C++ source file
with warnings about deprecated constructs enabled.  These warnings are
enabled by default, but can be disabled with <span class="option">-Wno-deprecated</span>.

     <br><dt><code>__EXCEPTIONS</code><dd>This macro is defined, with value 1, when compiling a C++ source file
with exceptions enabled.  If <span class="option">-fno-exceptions</span> is used when
compiling the file, then this macro is not defined.

     <br><dt><code>__GXX_RTTI</code><dd>This macro is defined, with value 1, when compiling a C++ source file
with runtime type identification enabled.  If <span class="option">-fno-rtti</span> is
used when compiling the file, then this macro is not defined.

     <br><dt><code>__USING_SJLJ_EXCEPTIONS__</code><dd>This macro is defined, with value 1, if the compiler uses the old
mechanism based on <code>setjmp</code> and <code>longjmp</code> for exception
handling.

     <br><dt><code>__GXX_EXPERIMENTAL_CXX0X__</code><dd>This macro is defined when compiling a C++ source file with the option
<span class="option">-std=c++0x</span> or <span class="option">-std=gnu++0x</span>. It indicates that some
features likely to be included in C++0x are available. Note that these
features are experimental, and may change or be removed in future
versions of GCC.

     <br><dt><code>__GXX_WEAK__</code><dd>This macro is defined when compiling a C++ source file.  It has the
value 1 if the compiler will use weak symbols, COMDAT sections, or
other similar techniques to collapse symbols with &ldquo;vague linkage&rdquo;
that are defined in multiple translation units.  If the compiler will
not collapse such symbols, this macro is defined with value 0.  In
general, user code should not need to make use of this macro; the
purpose of this macro is to ease implementation of the C++ runtime
library provided with G++.

     <br><dt><code>__NEXT_RUNTIME__</code><dd>This macro is defined, with value 1, if (and only if) the NeXT runtime
(as in <span class="option">-fnext-runtime</span>) is in use for Objective-C.  If the GNU
runtime is used, this macro is not defined, so that you can use this
macro to determine which runtime (NeXT or GNU) is being used.

     <br><dt><code>__LP64__</code><dt><code>_LP64</code><dd>These macros are defined, with value 1, if (and only if) the compilation
is for a target where <code>long int</code> and pointer both use 64-bits and
<code>int</code> uses 32-bit.

     <br><dt><code>__SSP__</code><dd>This macro is defined, with value 1, when <span class="option">-fstack-protector</span> is in
use.

     <br><dt><code>__SSP_ALL__</code><dd>This macro is defined, with value 2, when <span class="option">-fstack-protector-all</span> is
in use.

     <br><dt><code>__TIMESTAMP__</code><dd>This macro expands to a string constant that describes the date and time
of the last modification of the current source file. The string constant
contains abbreviated day of the week, month, day of the month, time in
hh:mm:ss form, year and looks like <code>"Sun&nbsp;Sep&nbsp;16&nbsp;01:03:52&nbsp;1973"<!-- /@w --></code>. 
If the day of the month is less than 10, it is padded with a space on the left.

     <p>If GCC cannot determine the current date, it will emit a warning message
(once per compilation) and <code>__TIMESTAMP__</code> will expand to
<code>"???&nbsp;???&nbsp;??&nbsp;??:??:??&nbsp;????"<!-- /@w --></code>.

     <br><dt><code>__GCC_HAVE_SYNC_COMPARE_AND_SWAP_1</code><dt><code>__GCC_HAVE_SYNC_COMPARE_AND_SWAP_2</code><dt><code>__GCC_HAVE_SYNC_COMPARE_AND_SWAP_4</code><dt><code>__GCC_HAVE_SYNC_COMPARE_AND_SWAP_8</code><dt><code>__GCC_HAVE_SYNC_COMPARE_AND_SWAP_16</code><dd>These macros are defined when the target processor supports atomic compare
and swap operations on operands 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 bytes in length, respectively.
